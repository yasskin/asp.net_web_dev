# Object-Oriented Programming
## What does object-oriented programming really mean?

* Objects have attributes and behaviors

# Types 3:14
## with Jeremy McLain

## Every class defines a new type. Objects are just instances of a type.

* Every object is of a certain type
  * 5 10 23 are objects of type int
  * 3.14 is an object of type double
  * "Hello" "Bob" are objects of type string

* Class is a template for making individual objects of a particular type
* Type and classes can be used interchangeably
* An object is an instance of a type
